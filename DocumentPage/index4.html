            A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.
            For example, we can store a list of items having the same data-type using the array data structure
        </p>

    <section id="array" class="main-section">
        <header>Array</header>
        <p>
            An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. 
            The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. 
            This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

    <section id="linkedlist" class="main-section">
        <header>Linked List</header>
        <p>
            A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.
            In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.
            <ul>
                <li>Singly Linked List</li>
                 <li>Doubly Linked List</li>
                 <li>Circular Linked List</li>
            </ul>  
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="queue" class="main-section">
        <header>Queue</header>
        <p>
            A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="stack" class="main-section">
        <header>Stack</header>
        <p>
            Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
            There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider an example of plates stacked over one another in the canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time. So, it can be simply seen to follow LIFO(Last In First Out)/FILO(First In Last Out) order.

        <header>Tree</header>
        <p>
            Tree represents the nodes connected by edges. We will discuss binary tree or binary search tree specifically.

            Binary Tree is a special datastructure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.

    <section id="graph" class="main-section">
        <header>Graph</header>
        <p>
            A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph can be defined as,

            <i>A Graph consists of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes.</i>  
        </p>

    <section id="hashing" class="main-section">
        <header>Hashing</header>
        <p>
          Hashing is an important Data Structure which is designed to use a special function called the Hash function which is used to map a given value with a particular key for faster access of elements. The efficiency of mapping depends of the efficiency of the hash function used.

Let a hash function H(x) maps the value x at the index x%10 in an Array. For example if the list of values is [11,12,13,14,15] it will be stored at positions {1,2,3,4,5} in the array or Hash table respectively.
